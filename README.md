# Neural Network
3-layer feedforward neural network in Python

This is a very basic implementation of a neural network in Python. It is currently designed to be used on the MNIST training set specifically. If you would like to use this for a different purpose feel free to open up an issue and I'll gladly modify it to be more modular.
